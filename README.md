# 🌇 Design patterns
While coding the game i learned about design patterns and implemented them gradually.
I would re-do a some parts differently but hey let's not touch what is not broken 😎
### Design patterns i used: visitors, composition over inheritance, observers, singleton.

# 💔 Healbars
## Procedurally generated
Every section delimited by thin vertical black lines represent 50hp.
The health bar design intuitively indicates the enemy's total health points to the player.
Additionally there is a color gradient from green = 100 to red = 0.
